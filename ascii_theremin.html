        <b>ASCII Theremin (2023)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a virtual theremin that allows users to view themselves in an ASCII videoscape and play music. It uses P5.js and ML5.js libraries to play sound and change visuals when an index finger is detected on the screen. As a result, user will intentionally and accidentally play sounds 
        when their finger “touches” a certain coordinate of the frame, often resulting in a cacophony of sounds.             
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project, I’ve collected sounds from the web to explore the ideas of past, present, and future. When the user slides through the left border, some royalty-free stock 
        sounds from the internet that came up under the keywords “retro” and “vintage” (cassette tape insert, arcade game sound effects, old phone ringtone, old windows computer sound, etc.) will play. When the user slides through the right border,
        sounds that came up when searching for “future” (futuristic corporate logo effects, plasma gun sounds, rocket launch, etc.) will play. 
        Moving the finger in the middle of the frame will evoke familiar sounds of current technologies -- iphone type sound, iphone vibrate, or mouse and keyboard clicks, depending on the movement speed. 
        Sliding your finger through the horizontal borders of the frame will play chime and grand piano sounds from Ableton. Lastly, I’ve also hid some random surprises like drum beats, animal noises, and sword sounds.
      </p>
      <p>This project was created as the final project during School For Poetic Computation's Musical Web Fall 2023 cohort.</p>
      <p>To fully experience the project, camera and Wi-Fi access is required, and a desktop browser is recommended.</p>
