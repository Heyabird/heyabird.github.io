        <p>Writing is something I'd like to get better at. Ironically, the rise in the usage of AI tools like Chat-GPT in writing is making me feel more confident about my awkward and imperfect writing. The main goal of my writing is to be genuine (while also trying to maintain some clarity), but I'm not sure if I succeeded at doing so. Anyways, here are a few of them.</p>

                <p>I recently learned that Junior Naver (쥬니어 네이버 or 쥬니버), a Korean portal site for children best remembered from its flash games, is shutting down on May 27th, 2025. Although I hadn’t visited the site since I was a tiny kid, the news still struck me with melancholy. It felt as if a beloved playground from my hometown was

                <p>My first dream was to be a writer. I spent my childhood scribbling words on notebooks and crafting imaginary characters. I was more interested in creating stories than talking, studying, and other forms of living. People often forgot I was there. At home, my nickname became “ghost” because I would silently work on my makeshift
