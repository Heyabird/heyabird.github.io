                <p>This summer, I had the privilege of participating in the SFPC class ‚ÄúAlternative Typographic Histories‚Äù, led by instructors Levi and Hind. This course introduced me and others to the intricate Western and Arabic typographic histories, while also inviting us to develop our own unique visual languages rooted in personal narratives. My encounter with the class and thus SFPC‚Äôs pedagogy has been surprising and transformative, both personally and artistically.</p>
                <p>Looking back, I acknowledge that I could have embarked on a research and creative project for a similar topic on my own. However, what truly stood out about the SFPC experience was its emphasis on collective learning. Each one of us, including instructors, engaged in mutual learning and sharing of information ‚Äì specifically, information that mattered to us. While I created an interactive coding project inspired by research in my East Asian heritage, a classmate wrote a manifesto on algospeak and counter surveillance languages related to their activism work, while another connected their grandfather‚Äôs handwriting to broader technological contexts like language processing. Each story shared in the class was thought-provoking, inspiring, and deeply personal. </p>
                <p>As a fellow student phrased it, this class has been a lovely ‚Äúcollective daydreaming‚Äù that I am honored to have joined. Thanks to everyone who was in it, it has become a foundational stepping stone in my newfound passion for computational art and practice of imagining alternative histories. Not only that, it has taught me the importance of having a community of peers who are willing to be vulnerable together and supportive of each others‚Äô creative paths. That just felt right, and I realized that my artistic journey wouldn‚Äôt make sense without it.</p>

            <h1 class="title"><b>On Staying focused</b></h1>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p class="blogpost-info">July 24, 2021</p>
                <p>If you know me, you might know me as a girl who likes to bounce around and try a lot things. You're not wrong. Ever since I finished high school, my goal has been to explore the world and myself as much as I can.</p>
                <p>And so I did. I lived my life like I was getting flavor samples from Baskin Robbins. During the past 8 years, I worked a lot of different <a class="footnote-link" href="#section1">jobs [1]</a>, formed relationships with all sorts of people, acquired various random skills, and moved <a class="footnote-link" href="#section2">cities [2]</a> quite frequently. Overall, it was fun living as a professional amateur.</p>
                <p>But that came at a cost: I was missing out on depth. As a master of none, I got to know many things superficially but rarely something very intimately. I also felt like I was missing a strong focus in life, as my direction kept shifting every month, day, or, sometimes, hour. And I didn't like how that felt anymore.</p>
                <p>So, more recently, I've been feeling this immense desire to stay focused and dig deep on a <a class="footnote-link" href="#section3">less number of things [3]</a>. Whether it be an entity, skill, object, or experience, I want to take my time in getting to know it slowly and deeply.</p>
                <p>I know that this will be challeging for me at times, as my curiosity (or greed?) kicks in and tells to keep switching flavors. I can let myself <a class="footnote-link" href="#section4">indulge [4]</a> in that voice from time to time, but I will also remind myself that life is short, and I can't have everything.</p>
                <p>Changing flavors every bite means that I'll never know the second layer of the thing I've already bitten. And some things are worth choosing and diving deeper.</p>
                <p>I guess I'm finally seeing the beauty of commitment, and I am here to stay. At least for a little while. üßÉ</p>
