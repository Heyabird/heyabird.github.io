            <h2><b>On Staying Focused</b></h2>
            <p class="blogpost-info">July 24, 2021</p>
            <p>If you know me, you might know me as a girl who likes to bounce around and try a lot things. You're not wrong. Ever since I finished high school, my goal has been to explore the world and myself as much as I can.</p>
            <p>And so I did. I lived my life like I was getting flavor samples from Baskin Robbins. During the past 7 years, I worked a lot of different <a class="footnote-link" href="#section1">jobs [1]</a>, formed relationships with all sorts of people, acquired various random skills, and moved <a class="footnote-link" href="#section2">cities [2]</a> quite frequently. Overall, it was fun living as a professional amateur.</p>
            <p>But that came at a cost: I was missing out on depth. As a master of none, I got to know many things superficially but rarely something very intimately. I also felt like I was missing a strong focus in life, as my direction kept shifting every month, day, or, sometimes, hour. And I didn't like how that felt anymore.</p>
            <p>So, more recently, I've been feeling this immense desire to stay focused and dig deep on a <a class="footnote-link" href="#section3">less number of things [3]</a>. Whether it be an entity, skill, object, or experience, I want to take my time in getting to know it slowly and deeply.</p>
            <p>I know that this will be challeging for me at times, as my curiosity (or greed?) kicks in and tells to keep switching flavors. I can let myself <a class="footnote-link" href="#section4">indulge [4]</a> in that voice from time to time, but I will also remind myself that life is short, and I can't have everything.</p>
            <p>Changing flavors every bite means that I'll never know the second layer of the thing I've already bitten. And some things are worth choosing and diving deep.</p>
            <p>I guess I'm finally seeing the beauty of commitment, and I am here to stay. At least for a little while. ðŸ§ƒ</p>

                <p id="section4">[4] I've learned that balance matters, so I will always let myself have sprinkles of newness here and there. I know that there's still so much of the world and myself to explore anyways. It's just that my <i>focus</i> will be on, well, focusing.</p>
