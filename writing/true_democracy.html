                <p><i>The following is my paper for a social philosophy class written in April 2016, during my junior year of college.</i></p>
                <p>[In the middle of an ocean exists a ship, and on the ship exists the Democratic State of the Ship.
                    As far as they can remember, the people of the Ship have always been living there, constantly
                    threatened by the harshest of the waves. Due to the waves, the ship rocks violently, and injuries
                    and deaths occur on a daily basis. Consequently, everyone’s energy is focused on protecting the
                    ship from the dangerous waves. The captains of the Ship—Don, Sage, and Shin—are in charge
                    of steering the ship in a way that minimizes the adverse effects of the waves in addition to
                    overseeing the Ship.<br/>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>SCENE 1</b>
                    <br/><br/>
                    [In the Captains’ Room, Sage and Shin wake up to Don shaking their bodies.]<br/><br/>
                    DON: Guys, wake up! We are facing a crisis!<br/>
                    SAGE: [Rubbing his eyes] What’s wrong? Are the waves getting really bad?<br/>
                    DON: No, it’s actually the opposite; the harsh waves have ceased! It’s the first time in my life
                    seeing the ocean so peaceful. However, at the same time, people of the Ship are planning a revolt
                    against us. Now that they don’t need to depend on our steering skills anymore, they are starting
                    to question why we are the rulers.
                    SHIN: Oh no! What should we do?<br/>
                    DON: The people are chanting: “We want less dictatorship! We want more democracy! We want
                    true democracy!” They claim that our rule is dictatorship. We have to give them what they
                    demand – true democracy! That’s the only solution to this crisis!<br/>
                    SHIN: But what the hell does that mean? “Democracy”? I thought our state was already one?
                    <br/>
                    SAGE: Democracy is part of our state’s name, but that doesn’t mean much.
                    DON: I have an idea. Democracy is more than just a name; it is a set of specific institutional
                    structures. Let’s implement a system of equal rights and equal access to legislative processes. We
                    should also propose the idea of elections where they can vote for the next set of captains.
                    SHIN and SAGE: Okay, let’s try that.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>SCENE 2</b>
                    <br/><br/>
                    [One week passes, and various democratic structures are implemented. However, people remain
                    dissatisfied. They start to get angrier, threatening to kill the captains.]<br/><br/>
                    DON: Oh gosh, these people are ready to kill us! We gave them democracy, but they’re still
                    mad!<br/>
                    SAGE: Wait a minute; I think I know why they are. What we gave them is not true democracy.
                    Democracy is more than mere institutional structures; it is the way people converse with one
                    another and shape the society through their will. Politics itself should be based on their own
                    genuine decision-makings. We must give them true democracy.<br/>
                    SHIN: But how could we possibly do that?<br/>
                    SAGE: Well, first, we must step down from our captainship. They gotta rule by their own will.
                    We can make gathering spaces – salons, and such – for people to come together to share a
                    democratic discourse and collectively decide on what our society should look like. In fact, we
                    should stop occupying this Captains’ Room and having these meetings. This room should be
                    turned into another salon.<br/>
                    DON: Brilliant! Let’s do that.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>SCENE 3</b>
                    <br/><br/>
                    [One week passes, but people remain dissatisfied; although the captains have stepped down and a
                    plenty of salon spaces are created, given the big size and diversity of the population, people are
                    unable to reach much consensus. In fact, people start to fight over what true “democracy” means.
                    At this point, people become angry with one other. Don senses the urgency of the situation and
                    calls Sage and Shin to a basement room.]<br/><br/>
                    DON: Okay, I know we’ve stepped down from our rule, but this is a disaster and we oughta do
                    something. People are starting to kill one another!<br/>
                    SAGE: What could we do? They demanded democracy, so we gave it to them. We gave them the
                    structural democracy, and we gave them the way to have substantial democracy. But I see no
                    democracy, only frustrations. So what do they mean when they say they want more democracy
                    or true democracy?<br/>
                    DON: Oh, we’re all screwed! We’ve finally escaped the harsh waves, but now we’re faced with
                    another crisis!<br/>
                    SHIN: Wait! I think I have an idea.<br/>
                    SAGE: You do?<br/>
                    SHIN: Yea, let’s try one more thing: let’s use our muscles this time.<br/>
                    SAGE: Do you mean we should fight them? That’s not gonna work – look at their numbers!<br/>
                    SHIN: No, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is: let’s use our muscles to rock the ship.<br/>
                    DON and SAGE: Rock the ship?!<br/>
                    SHIN: Yes, rock the ship.<br/><br/>
                    [Don and Sage looks at each other confusedly.]<br/><br/>
                    SAGE: Are you nuts? We’ve waited all our lives for this peaceful time to come. We finally don’t
                    have to worry about the waves! Now you are telling us to rock the ship?<br/>
                    DON: I think you’re going crazy! Rocking the boat puts everyone, including us, in danger!
                    We’re already dealing with a crisis right now, we can’t handle another one!<br/>
                    SHIN: We have to rock the ship.<br/><br/>
                    [They hear the cries from upstairs, where people are fighting to death.]<br/><br/>
                    SAGE: Alright, I think you’re crazy, but we might else well try!<br/><br/>
                    [Don, Sage, and Shin starts running back and forth in the basement and pushing the walls on
                    each side. After a few tries, the ship starts to rock, although very slightly. However, people starts
                    to sense the rocking and panic.]<br/><br/>
                    People of the Ship: Oh no! The boat is rocking again! We are all gonna die!<br/><br/>
                    [The people stop fighting and start crying in misery. Soon, some urge others to go to one of the
                    salons to have a talk. For the first time in a while, they start to seriously listen to each other.
                    After long discussions, they reach the consensus that they will ask the ex-captains for help. The
                    ex-captains could use their steering skills again to minimize the turbulence.]<br/><br/>
                    People of the Ship: (to Don, Shin, and Sage) Please help us! Please dictate over us!
                    <br/><br/>
                    <b>SCENE 4</b>
                    <br/><br/>
                    DON: So, after all, we found the solution to the crisis in our Ship: another crisis.
                    SAGE: And now we dictate over the Ship.<br/>
                    SHIN: But our dictatorship was demanded democratically. So, I guess for us, this is what true
                    democracy looks like.<br/><br/>
                    [From now on, the three men remain captains. They secretly rotate in a way that, at all times, one
                    of them is ruling over the Ship while two of them are rocking the ship. Perhaps, finally, the days
                    of peace have arrived at the Ship.]<br/><br/></p>
