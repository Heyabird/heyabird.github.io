                    I put <span class="highlight">5 disposable cameras</span> in a box with instructions and a <span class="highlight">logbook</span>. I gave each box (which I call Trust Box) to someone I trust. They each took <span class="highlight">3 photos</span> (one that reminds them of the previous person, one of their surrounding, and one of why they trust the next person) and signed the logbook. Then, they passed on the box to another person they trust, and so on, so that each roll consists of <span class="highlight">8 to 9 people</span>*.

                    A few weeks later, I was able to retrieve 4 out of 5 Trust Boxes. And two months later, the 5th box came back as well. Each box ended up in a different city: Espoo, Helsinki, Vihti, Tampere, and Sweden (City TBA). Here are the scans of the photos and logbook notes from the boxes.

                    *because I couldn't control how exactly the process goes, some chains only had 8 people, and most chains had less than the total number of exposures per camera (27 photos) taken. This means, sometimes a person took only 2 photos instead of 3. I was able to talk to some of the participants who reached out about this, and put "missing photo" placeholder in such cases. In other cases (since not all participants messaged me), I made my best guess on which photos are taken by whom.
