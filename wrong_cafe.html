<p>Description: On the roof of Väärätalo is Wrong Café – an odd pop-up café operated by a lone waitress. The café serves coffee, pastries, and questions, all free of charge. In return, visitors are invited to add to an evolving myth rooted in Väärätalo and shaped by their own dreams and experiences. Each tale will be recorded and passed to the next guest, transforming along the way like a game of telephone. Together, these fragments will weave into a strange urban folklore that blurs fact and fiction.</p>
