                Heya Kwon (she/they) is a Korean American artist-researcher working across sound, new media, 
                and participatory practices. With a background in social theory, music, and software engineering, 
                she approaches art and technology as tools 
                for critical reflection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by media archaeology and Buddhism, her artistic research practice examines 
                the pyschological, material, and ecological conditions of media systems with a 
                focus on media exhaustion. She is particularly interested in slowness
                and rest as ways of resistance in our current extractive and
                accelerationist technological regimes.
                <!-- Through installations, performances, 
                and workshops, Heya is interested in ways of slowness, no-action, maintenance, and care 
                as acts of resistance in extractive and accelerationist technological regimes. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                She is currently pursuing an MA in New Media at Aalto 
                University in Helsinki, Finland, and holds a BA in Social Studies (Political and Social Theory) from Wesleyan University 
                in Middletown, Connecticut, USA.
