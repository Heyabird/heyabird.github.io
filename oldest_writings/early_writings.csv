Lambert reports that it has been suggested the interpolation may have arisen through an epithet of the father (‘man of Shuruppak’) having been taken wrongly for a proper name. However, this epithet, found in the Gilgamesh XI tablet, is a designation applied to Utnapishtim, not his father."

A recent count estimated that there were about 13,000 bones with a total of a little over 130,000 inscriptions in collections in China and some fourteen other countries. <br/><br/> Diviners would submit questions to deities regarding weather, crop planting, the fortunes of members of the royal family, military endeavors, and similar topics. These questions were carved onto the bone or shell in oracle bone script using a sharp tool. Intense heat was then applied with a metal rod until the bone or shell cracked due to thermal expansion. The diviner would then interpret the pattern of cracks and write the prognostication upon the piece as well. Pyromancy with bones continued in China into the Zhou dynasty, but the questions and prognostications were increasingly written with brushes and cinnabar ink, which degraded over time."

The Phi Yü Ching on 'liu-ho' paper made in Liu-ho in northern Chiangsu. It is made from six different materials.<br/>The Han dynasty Chinese court official Cai Lun (c. 50–121 CE) is credited as the inventor of a method of papermaking (inspired by wasps and bees) using rags and other plant fibers in 105 CE. However, the discovery of specimens bearing written Chinese characters in 2006 at Fangmatan in north-east China's Gansu Province suggests that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BCE, and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from the early 2nd century BCE. It therefore would appear that ‘Cai Lun's contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically, fix a recipe for papermaking’."

The tablets were requests for intervention of the goddess Sulis Minerva in the return of stolen goods and to curse the perpetrators of the thefts.

It is clearly the product of a mature industry and it is believed that printing was invented in eighth-century China when someone experimented with carving a woodblock for a page of text rather than small Buddha stamps. Only a century after Wang Jie ordered the printing of this text Sichuan woodcarvers were employed to produce the first large-scale printing project in the world; the Buddhist Canon.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock_printing

It marked the start of the Gutenberg Revolution and the age of printed books in the West. The book is valued and revered for its high aesthetic and artistic qualities and its historical significance.<br/><br/>The Gutenberg Bible is an edition of the Latin Vulgate printed in the 1450s by Johannes Gutenberg in Mainz (Holy Roman Empire), in present-day Germany. Out of either 158 or 180 copies that were originally printed, 49 survive in at least substantial portion, 21 of them in entirety. They are thought to be among the world's most valuable books, although no complete copy has been sold since 1978. In March 1455, the future Pope Pius II wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible displayed in Frankfurt to promote the edition."
